~~Invite the bot to your Discord server.~~

**This bot has been retired. The source code will remain for anyone who wishes to be inspired to continue it.**

## What It Does

It sends information on recently verified speedruns for any game or runner (on speedrun.com) that you pick.

It can also DM you recent submissions for any game.

## Setting Up Verified Runs

1. Invite RUN GET to your server
2. Make sure it can read messages and send embeds
3. Have the server owner send a message like `@RUN GET #any-text-channel game`

Notes:

* Games must be the abbreviation from speedrun.com (example: Kirby's Dream Land is `speedrun.com/kdl`, so you would use `kdl` as the game)
* Runners must end with an `*` to differentiate them from games (if the runner has their Twitch account linked to speedrun.com, you can use that)
* You can input multiple games and runners at once, but only one channel
* If you want to remove a game or runner, put a `!` before the game or runner
* Send the message `?rungetgames` to get a list of all games and runners being monitored (put an `!` at the end to get the channels, too)

## Setting Up Submitted Runs

1. Be in a server with RUN GET and start a DM
2. Send a direct message like `@RUN GET game`

Notes:

* Games must be formatted like when setting up verified runs
* You can specify a user (with an `*` at the end of the name) and RUN GET will automatically add all games that user moderates
* Like before, to remove a game, put a `!` before the game
* The message `?rungetgames` works here, too
